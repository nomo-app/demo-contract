# Demo Contract for interacting with the Zeniq Smart Chain

This is a demo contract for interacting with the Zeniq Smart Chain.

The Contract is a HardHat project and uses the hardhat-toolbox dependency.
Moreover the project uses TypeScript for type safety.

This contract is meant to be used as a starting point for your own contracts, so feel free to **copy and modify** it.

For more information on how to write Smart Contracts with HardHat, please refer to the [HardHat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).
